questions:

1. are we going to add allocations as deployment params similar to
   flt/Vesting.sol?
2. are the amounts dynamic? e.g. the contract owner can allocate both 1M FLT or 1B FLT?
3. is the

things to do

- get some data from a moonshot like SIF/USD, analyze the tx distribution
- similar to helius, see if can get 'reputation' score and try to snipe new launches,
  something like dextools.io real time launches
